# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection Using CNN (Deep Learning Project)

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Built and trained using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, it leverages computer vision techniques to classify X-rays as either *Pneumonia* or *Normal*.
